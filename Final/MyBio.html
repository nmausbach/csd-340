                        <p>I have always loved music and started playing the trumpet and guitar when I was about 12 years old. I have been involved with symphonic bands, jazz bands, honor bands, and marching bands. It has always been a source of reducing stress and enjoyment.</p>

                        <p>While I've received plenty of awards and decorations in my military career, the one that was most important to me is pictured above. It represents the last time my unit held internal "competitions" to see who was best at their respective jobs, and where all the hard work I put in every day was truly appreciated.</p>
